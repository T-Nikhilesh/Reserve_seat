# Train Seat Reservation System

## Overview
This project is a Train Seat Reservation System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to select and book seats from a visual layout of a train coach. The layout includes 11 rows with 7 seats each and 1 row with 3 seats, and it provides feedback on available and already booked seats.

The project is fully responsive, ensuring that the seat layout adjusts for various screen sizes from desktops to mobile devices. The system also incorporates a custom scrollbar for a better user experience and provides error messages when seats are unavailable.

## Features
* Dynamic Seat Selection: Users can view available seats, and book them.
* Real-Time Availability Check: Displays available and already booked seats.
* Custom Scrollbars: Modern, styled scrollbars for a clean UI.
* Responsive Design: The seat layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes, from large desktops to mobile phones.
* Error Handling: Displays appropriate messages when no seats are available.

## Technology Stack
* HTML: Markup for the structure of the seat layout and input section.
* CSS: Styling for seat layout, custom scrollbars, and responsive design.
* JavaScript: Handles the logic for seat selection, booking, and availability messages.
